<h2> Project 3 </h2>
<p>
  For Project 3, I created a Flask web application that has 4 webpages: Homepage, System Information, Storage Space, and System Uptime. The homepage welcomes the user and contains links for the other three pages. The System Information page displays information for the system that the app is hosted on. This information includes currently logged in user, computer name, OS, OS release, OS version, and processor. The Storage Space page displays total, used, and available disk space for the local system in gigabytes. Finally, the System Uptime page displays uptime for the local host machine in week, day, hour, minute format.
