My script for Project 1 is a Powershell script that tells you how much hard drive space you have available. In the case of our VM's, we only have a C drive. So the script tells you the amount of space that is free on your C drive. The output should be 1 line of text that says how much space is free. For example: "You have 14.49 GB of remaining disk space." To run the script, all you need to do is execute the ps1 file in Powershell. Alternatively, you can open up the file in Powershell ISE and run it through there while viewing the code.
