Lab 7:

The plugin I chose for Lab 7 is a Python plugin called "textstat." To install textstat, all you need to do is enter "python3 -m pip install textstat" into the cli. The script I wrote imports the textstat plugin and uses functions from textstat to calculate stats for the text that you manually enter. So, all you have to do is run the script, enter your text data as prompted, and then the script responds by outputting your data results. The 5 functions of textstat that I included in this script is: Character Count, Letter Count, Syllable Count, Sentence Count, and Grade level.
